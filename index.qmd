# Preface {.unnumbered}

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION NOT FOR CICRULATION]

Mathematics is the language of the Universe, and like any foreign language, it's not something you learn, it's something you get used to. This book is an artifact resulting from getting used to it over ten years as working scientists and before that 9 years of Phd/MA/BA. Its design philsophy is not to be a coherent text but rather a reference guide. The reader should be able to quickly turn to a topic (or find it through the search bar), and see multiple representations of that idea in english, formalism, code, and relevant papers. It is not designed to teach these topics for the first time, rather it is to help a working applied scientist quickly relearn and apply a topic.

Do you see companies asking to implement algorithm from scratch? Yes, some companies like LinkedIn, Intuit did. The common questions include: implement kmeans, linear/logistic regression. You can find the code here.
