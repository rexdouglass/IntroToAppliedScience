# Outcome regressions / Response Surface Modeling  {.unnumbered}

[@degtiarReviewGeneralizabilityTransportability2023]
"fit an outcome regression in study
sample data to estimate conditional means, then obtain PATEs by marginalizing
over (i.e., standardizing to) the target sample covariate distribution by predicting counterfactuals for the target sample
If the target sample is not a simple random sample from the target population,
this would be a weighted average using sampling weights (Kim et al., 2018)."
