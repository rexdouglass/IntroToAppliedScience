# Neural Network Debugging

"Since this seriously helped a friend the other day: If your network doesn't learn, reduce the dataset to a small batch (eg 32 examples) and try to overfit on it. The loss should be near zero (because the network should be able to memorize it); if not, there's a bug in your code."
